This was a very tough set up for this blog. I had alot of issues installing Ruby. I was able to download version 2 but had issues with bundle install. I then had to install Ruby version 3 which I also had issues with. How it made me feel.

After that though it was smooth saiing getting everything set up and installed. Markdown is a new languae to me but it appears very simple. The only real struggle was Ruby. Here are the things I am looking forward to: 
- Building cool websites
- learning new languages
- Workig with a community partner

Hopefully it will be very cool.
