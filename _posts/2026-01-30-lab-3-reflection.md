This lab was definitley easier than the lab before. Editing the stlye.css for the md that was already created was a new concept. Having to find the areas in the code I wanted to edit proved interesting. It took alot of investigative work.

I used <a href="https://coolors.co/">this website</a> to pick out my new colors. I wanted to also incorperate some brown. I mean look how good it looks on this Blue-winged kookaburra at the <a href="https://www.zoo-landau.de/">Landau Zoo</a> in Germany.

I'm looking forward to continuing the development of this blog throughout this course.
